# Professional Skills for the Workplace

## Week 1: Emotional and Social Intelligence

### Self-Reflection and Journaling

Self-reflection and journaling are an opportunity to **pause** in order to think about what you have learned or recall events that are relevant to the learning material, to take notice of your thoughts and feelings, and write down what is on your mind. If you have never kept a journal before or done many self-reflection exercises, writing down your thoughts and feelings may seem awkward at first. We encourage you to not let this awkward feeling prevent you from exploring your thoughts and feelings as you progress through this course. Fully utilizing these moments and the tools
provided to you will ensure you have a rich learning experience, and lead to longer retention of the material provided.

### Promoting Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace

The last few decades have changed a lot about doing business. Importantly, there have been many positive developments in how we approach work and team building. One important development is the increased understanding of the impact of emotional intelligence in the workplace.

It’s true that the importance of emotional intelligence for individuals is well understood. But it’s also a critical part of
building a healthy team. Below we explain what emotional intelligence is  and how it can help strengthen your hiring decisions and team dynamics.

#### A Quick Emotional Intelligence Definition

The concept of emotional intelligence, or “emotional quotient” is meant to work alongside IQ — intelligence quotient. IQ doesn’t fully measure a person’s ability or competency. Emotional intelligence, while harder to measure, is a way to complement the picture. A common emotional intelligence definition is “the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.”

Some definitions also include four more precise areas of competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. Of these, self-awareness is considered the core of high EI. If you don’t know yourself and your own motivations, you are poorly equipped to understand others.

One thing that is important to understand is that emotional intelligence in the workplace and elsewhere is not a “soft skill,” and that it is no less important than IQ. It might even be more important. Being able to manage your emotions allows a person to deal with complex and stressful situations more adeptly. High emotional intelligence is a critical trait for leaders and innovators of all types. It helps with everything from building strategies to conflict management.

EQ is a key differentiator in the business world. People with high emotional intelligence make more, perform better and are more likely to close deals.

#### Hiring for Emotional Intelligence

Building a resilient team starts with hiring the right people. We celebrate high performers and brilliant minds, but a team is a team. This means promoting emotional intelligence in the workplace is a must. No one builds a successful
business alone. A team of average performers who work together masterfully is going to outperform a bad team with one star player every time.

Beyond that though, there is evidence that emotional intelligence is a better indicator of individual success as well. Someone with high emotional intelligence is a great hire at every level. It’s hard to measure EQ, so you have to draw it out through personal interaction. Here are some tips on selecting candidates with high emotional intelligence:

Avoid “personality tests.” Personality is not the same as emotional intelligence. Be wary of self-reporting tests as well — if a person isn’t self-aware, how can they report their EQ accurately?

Really talk to the candidate’s references. Make sure to ask specific questions about behaviors that reflect on their emotional intelligence.

Finally, adjust your interview process to emphasize EQ. Speak informally. Ask questions that reveal the candidate’s self-awareness. Put into place hiring practices that give decision-makers time and context to select for this trait.

#### Encouraging Emotional Intelligence on Your Team

Unlike IQ, which is static, EQ is something that can be trained. Like with so many parts of a successful team, it starts with leadership. Make sure that your leadership demonstrates emotional intelligence in your management. Pay attention to your emotions. Encourage self-reflection. Listen actively, and often, and make this a part of your culture.

Additionally, an important part of emotional intelligence in the workplace is responding, rather than just reacting to, difficult situations. Work on managing your unconscious and immediate impulses to frustrating events and people. This takes practice! Learning to deal with difficult moments or difficult colleagues isn’t easy, but model the behavior and encourage it on your team.

It’s also important to celebrate team successes, and not just individual accomplishments. Recognize the parts that everyone played in getting a project to the end point. Having the social awareness to recognize people for their distinct contributions is a key part of emotional intelligence.

#### Emotional Intelligence Skills Are Key to Success

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in or what your goals are, you need to work with people to get things done. This means that understanding and improving emotional intelligence should be a key part of your strategy. One good thing about EQ is that if you practice it yourself, it will impact your team. This is an area where leadership can make a huge difference. Start with the tips above, but remember that it’s a life-long process.

### 7 Examples of High and Low EQ at Work

We know that high EI/EQ in the workplace is an advantage, but how do we know it when we see it? What does it look like? Here are some good examples of high vs. low EI/EQ at work.

#### An Upset Employee Finds a Compassionate Ear

We all get moody sometimes, even at work. How a person deals with her coworkers or employees when they are having a bad day is a good indication about her EI/EQ level.

If she doesn’t even notice the moodiness, ignores the employee, exacerbates the bad mood, or criticizes the employee and tells them to “snap out of it,” she probably has low EI/EQ. If, on the other hand, she notices that something is up, offers her employee compassion and understanding, and tries to cheer the employee up or distract them from their woes, that’s a great indicator that she has high EI/EQ.

##### People Listen to Each Other in Meetings

Unfortunately, not all meetings are positive and productive; sometimes meetings can devolve into everyone talking at once, no one offering any input at all, or-worst of all-shouting and heated arguments.

If an employee contributes to any of the above in a meeting, he is displaying low emotional intelligence. If he allows others to have their say, listens attentively and refrains from interrupting others, and gently but effectively keeps everyone on task, he is probably high in EI/EQ.

#### People Express Themselves Openly

A person who is comfortable speaking up about things that are important, and is just as comfortable listening to others talk about their own opinions, is showing high workplace EI/EQ. She is probably also adept at expressing her own emotions in an appropriate way and accepting of others who express their own emotions.

A person who keeps things bottled up or gets upset when others disagree with her at work is likely low in emotional intelligence. She might spar with her coworkers about their opinions, or conversely, expect everyone to simply keep all emotions and opinions to themselves.

#### Most Change Initiatives Work

If a workplace is generally high in emotional intelligence, it likely handles change well. Change initiatives are probably taken seriously and carried out in earnest.

On the flip side, workplaces with low emotional intelligence are resistant to change, fail to put in the effort necessary to make change initiatives succeed, or even actively sabotage them. Additionally, poorly through-out initiatives indicate that the management team is low in EI/EQ and does not understand how their proposed changes will affect their employees.

#### Flexibility

A workplace that offers flexibility and understanding of the complex, busy lives of organization members is one that is probably high in EI/EQ. Managers and executives who accept that people have differing needs and offer ways to work smarter are displaying a good sense of emotional intelligence.

Managers and executives who refuse to allow their employees flexibility and hold strictly to the way things have always been done (when there is no need to do so) are showing signs of low emotional intelligence.

#### People Have the Freedom to Be Creative

Similarly, workplaces that allow their employees the opportunity to be creative and innovative are high in EI/EQ. Giving people the chance to practice their creativity and think outside the box is not only a welcome gesture for employees, it is also a smart move for the workplace.

Workplaces that make their employees stick to strict policies and procedures (again, when there is no need for such strictness) are low in EI/EQ. Not understanding the value of creativity and our employee’s need to be imaginative and invested in their work is a hallmark of low EI/EQ.

#### People Meet Out of Work Time

Finally, a good sign of emotional intelligence in the workplace is when organization members meet outside of the workplace. Organizations where employees enjoy happy hours, having lunch together, or other social activities indicates that there is a high level of EI/EQ present.

Workplaces that don’t feature such strong bonds and those in which employees do not spend any non-working time together are likely low in EI/EQ. When people are emotionally intelligent, they tend to get along and see the value in investing their time and energy into workplace relationships, but people low in EI/EQ are generally not interested in building quality relationships with their peers (Dhanak, n.d.).
