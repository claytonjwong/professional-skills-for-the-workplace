# Professional Skills for the Workplace

## Week 1: Emotional and Social Intelligence

### Self-Reflection and Journaling

Self-reflection and journaling are an opportunity to **pause** in order to think about what you have learned or recall events that are relevant to the learning material, to take notice of your thoughts and feelings, and write down what is on your mind. If you have never kept a journal before or done many self-reflection exercises, writing down your thoughts and feelings may seem awkward at first. We encourage you to not let this awkward feeling prevent you from exploring your thoughts and feelings as you progress through this course. Fully utilizing these moments and the tools
provided to you will ensure you have a rich learning experience, and lead to longer retention of the material provided.

### Promoting Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace

The last few decades have changed a lot about doing business. Importantly, there have been many positive developments in how we approach work and team building. One important development is the increased understanding of the impact of emotional intelligence in the workplace.

It’s true that the importance of emotional intelligence for individuals is well understood. But it’s also a critical part of
building a healthy team. Below we explain what emotional intelligence is  and how it can help strengthen your hiring decisions and team dynamics.

#### A Quick Emotional Intelligence Definition

The concept of emotional intelligence, or “emotional quotient” is meant to work alongside IQ — intelligence quotient. IQ doesn’t fully measure a person’s ability or competency. Emotional intelligence, while harder to measure, is a way to complement the picture. A common emotional intelligence definition is “the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.”

Some definitions also include four more precise areas of competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. Of these, self-awareness is considered the core of high EI. If you don’t know yourself and your own motivations, you are poorly equipped to understand others.

One thing that is important to understand is that emotional intelligence in the workplace and elsewhere is not a “soft skill,” and that it is no less important than IQ. It might even be more important. Being able to manage your emotions allows a person to deal with complex and stressful situations more adeptly. High emotional intelligence is a critical trait for leaders and innovators of all types. It helps with everything from building strategies to conflict management.

EQ is a key differentiator in the business world. People with high emotional intelligence make more, perform better and are more likely to close deals.

#### Hiring for Emotional Intelligence

Building a resilient team starts with hiring the right people. We celebrate high performers and brilliant minds, but a team is a team. This means promoting emotional intelligence in the workplace is a must. No one builds a successful
business alone. A team of average performers who work together masterfully is going to outperform a bad team with one star player every time.

Beyond that though, there is evidence that emotional intelligence is a better indicator of individual success as well. Someone with high emotional intelligence is a great hire at every level. It’s hard to measure EQ, so you have to draw it out through personal interaction. Here are some tips on selecting candidates with high emotional intelligence:

Avoid “personality tests.” Personality is not the same as emotional intelligence. Be wary of self-reporting tests as well — if a person isn’t self-aware, how can they report their EQ accurately?

Really talk to the candidate’s references. Make sure to ask specific questions about behaviors that reflect on their emotional intelligence.

Finally, adjust your interview process to emphasize EQ. Speak informally. Ask questions that reveal the candidate’s self-awareness. Put into place hiring practices that give decision-makers time and context to select for this trait.

#### Encouraging Emotional Intelligence on Your Team

Unlike IQ, which is static, EQ is something that can be trained. Like with so many parts of a successful team, it starts with leadership. Make sure that your leadership demonstrates emotional intelligence in your management. Pay attention to your emotions. Encourage self-reflection. Listen actively, and often, and make this a part of your culture.

Additionally, an important part of emotional intelligence in the workplace is responding, rather than just reacting to, difficult situations. Work on managing your unconscious and immediate impulses to frustrating events and people. This takes practice! Learning to deal with difficult moments or difficult colleagues isn’t easy, but model the behavior and encourage it on your team.

It’s also important to celebrate team successes, and not just individual accomplishments. Recognize the parts that everyone played in getting a project to the end point. Having the social awareness to recognize people for their distinct contributions is a key part of emotional intelligence.

#### Emotional Intelligence Skills Are Key to Success

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in or what your goals are, you need to work with people to get things done. This means that understanding and improving emotional intelligence should be a key part of your strategy. One good thing about EQ is that if you practice it yourself, it will impact your team. This is an area where leadership can make a huge difference. Start with the tips above, but remember that it’s a life-long process.

### 7 Examples of High and Low EQ at Work

We know that high EI/EQ in the workplace is an advantage, but how do we know it when we see it? What does it look like? Here are some good examples of high vs. low EI/EQ at work.

#### An Upset Employee Finds a Compassionate Ear

We all get moody sometimes, even at work. How a person deals with her coworkers or employees when they are having a bad day is a good indication about her EI/EQ level.

If she doesn’t even notice the moodiness, ignores the employee, exacerbates the bad mood, or criticizes the employee and tells them to “snap out of it,” she probably has low EI/EQ. If, on the other hand, she notices that something is up, offers her employee compassion and understanding, and tries to cheer the employee up or distract them from their woes, that’s a great indicator that she has high EI/EQ.

##### People Listen to Each Other in Meetings

Unfortunately, not all meetings are positive and productive; sometimes meetings can devolve into everyone talking at once, no one offering any input at all, or-worst of all-shouting and heated arguments.

If an employee contributes to any of the above in a meeting, he is displaying low emotional intelligence. If he allows others to have their say, listens attentively and refrains from interrupting others, and gently but effectively keeps everyone on task, he is probably high in EI/EQ.

#### People Express Themselves Openly

A person who is comfortable speaking up about things that are important, and is just as comfortable listening to others talk about their own opinions, is showing high workplace EI/EQ. She is probably also adept at expressing her own emotions in an appropriate way and accepting of others who express their own emotions.

A person who keeps things bottled up or gets upset when others disagree with her at work is likely low in emotional intelligence. She might spar with her coworkers about their opinions, or conversely, expect everyone to simply keep all emotions and opinions to themselves.

#### Most Change Initiatives Work

If a workplace is generally high in emotional intelligence, it likely handles change well. Change initiatives are probably taken seriously and carried out in earnest.

On the flip side, workplaces with low emotional intelligence are resistant to change, fail to put in the effort necessary to make change initiatives succeed, or even actively sabotage them. Additionally, poorly through-out initiatives indicate that the management team is low in EI/EQ and does not understand how their proposed changes will affect their employees.

#### Flexibility

A workplace that offers flexibility and understanding of the complex, busy lives of organization members is one that is probably high in EI/EQ. Managers and executives who accept that people have differing needs and offer ways to work smarter are displaying a good sense of emotional intelligence.

Managers and executives who refuse to allow their employees flexibility and hold strictly to the way things have always been done (when there is no need to do so) are showing signs of low emotional intelligence.

#### People Have the Freedom to Be Creative

Similarly, workplaces that allow their employees the opportunity to be creative and innovative are high in EI/EQ. Giving people the chance to practice their creativity and think outside the box is not only a welcome gesture for employees, it is also a smart move for the workplace.

Workplaces that make their employees stick to strict policies and procedures (again, when there is no need for such strictness) are low in EI/EQ. Not understanding the value of creativity and our employee’s need to be imaginative and invested in their work is a hallmark of low EI/EQ.

#### People Meet Out of Work Time

Finally, a good sign of emotional intelligence in the workplace is when organization members meet outside of the workplace. Organizations where employees enjoy happy hours, having lunch together, or other social activities indicates that there is a high level of EI/EQ present.

Workplaces that don’t feature such strong bonds and those in which employees do not spend any non-working time together are likely low in EI/EQ. When people are emotionally intelligent, they tend to get along and see the value in investing their time and energy into workplace relationships, but people low in EI/EQ are generally not interested in building quality relationships with their peers (Dhanak, n.d.).

## Week 1: Self-Awareness

### List of Emotions

#### Positive
![](emotions_positive.png)

#### Negative
![](emotions_negative.png)

### Articulate Your Feelings

It’s not enough to know your emotions. People with high ESI have the ability to describe them to others. This communication is key when working with others that are still learning their emotional triggers and how to handle them.

Consider the following situations and describe how you would feel in each situation:

* You read an email that implies you dropped the ball.
* Your partner blames you for something you feel is unfair.
* Another driver cuts you off on the highway.
* A close friend or associate begins to cry unexpectedly.

By first identifying your own emotions and reactions, you become more mindful and start the process of building control.

Note how you typically respond to these situations by answering the following reflection questions. Be honest about your reactions.

1. What are the benefits of your response?
2. What are the consequences of your response?
3. What would be the benefits if you changed your response?
4. What will you do with this knowledge?

### The Ripple Effect of Emotions

We just learned and experienced that our emotions can have a ripple effect on others. Let's examine how many people you could be impacting.

* List the people you encounter each day: face-to-face, phone, email; look above and below yourself in the organization hierarchy.
* How many people do you touch over a week's time?
* How many people look to you for leadership, support, collaboration?
* How many people might be (directly or indirectly) impacted by your emotions or behaviors?
*  What different choices will you make with this information?

### Get Some Feedback

* Listen carefully and try not to get defensive
* Check your perceptions and paraphrase
* Ask questions for clarification; ask for examples, paraphrase again
* Evaluate the accuracy and potential value of what you heard
* Gather additional information from additional sources and/or observe your own behavior
* Do not overreact but do modify behavior when appropriate
* Say “Thank you for the feedback”. Learn to appreciate the learning you receive from feedback

### What Did You Take Away From Self-Awareness?

Take a moment to reflect and answer the following questions:

* What did you take away from the self-reflection exercises?
* What did you learn about the ripple effect of your emotions and behaviors?
* What did you learn about yourself when you asked others for their perspective?
* Remember your best day and a not so good day – what was the difference?

## Week 2: Self-Management and Self-Regulation

### Cognitive Distortion

* All or nothing or polarized thinking: You look at things in absolute, black and white categories.
* Overgeneralization: You view a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
* Mental Filter: You dwell on the negatives and ignore the positives.
* Discounting the positives: You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities “don’t count”.
* Jumping to conclusions: (a) mind reading – you assume people are reacting negatively to you when there’s no definite evidence; (b) fortune telling – you arbitrarily predict things will turn out badly.
* Magnification or Minimization: You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance inappropriately.
* Emotional Reasoning: You reason form ow you feel; “I feel like an idiot so I really must be one.” Or “I feel like doing this, so I’ll put it first.”
* Should Statements: You criticize yourself or other people with “shoulds” or “shouldn’ts.” “Musts”, “Oughts”, “have tos” are similar offenders.
* Labeling: YOU identify with your shortcomings. Instead of saying, “I made a mistake,” you tell yourself, “I am a jerk” or “a fool”.
* Personalization and Blame: You blame yourself for something you weren’t entirely responsible for, or you blame others and overlook ways that your own attitudes and behavior might contribute to a problem.

#### Answer the following questions:

* Which of these cognitive distortions resonated with you?
* How could you manage them when they come up?
* How will you change your self-talk?

### Practicing the Pause

"The pause" may be as simple as taking a moment to stop and think before we act or speak. If everyone made that a practice, imagine how much shorter emails could be, how much time would be saved in meetings, and how many incendiary comments on social media would be eliminated.

But remember: The pause is easy in theory, difficult to practice.

Even if we're generally good at managing our emotions, factors like added stress or a bad day can inhibit our ability to do so at any given time. And we're not just talking about upsetting situations; we are often tempted to jump on opportunities that look really good at the time but that we haven't really thought through. When you work on pausing before speaking or acting, you create a habit of thinking first.

* When was a time that you probably should have practiced the pause and didn't? How might that have changed the situation?
* What strategies can you incorporate to help you practice the pause more often?

### Journaling

#### What is journaling?

Simply put, journaling is “writing life down.” Two key reasons to keep a journal:

#### Recapturing the moment

Spending just a few minutes a day writing in a journal is an opportunity to slowdown, revisit key events of the day, and
describe what happened and what you recall thinking or feeling. Writing to reflect on how you reacted and felt throughout the day can provide useful insight into how you see yourself and the world around you. This knowledge can help you gauge the progress you’re making with your treatment plan.

#### Learning from the moment

Journaling is a great self-teaching tool. It provides a safe environment for examining how changing your thoughts or behaviors might bring about a different outcome. Many people find that once they’ve recounted the day’s events, they can also spend a few minutes journaling about the lessons of the day, and “practicing” alternative ways to react to stress, handle relationships, and recognize and appreciate life’s positive moments.

#### How can journaling help me take care of myself?
If you are looking to become more aware of your thoughts and more skilled at turning them around when you become
counterproductive or destructive, a written journal provides a place to “catch” those thoughts and experiment with how a different way of thinking might impact a given situation. You may find it helpful to share insights you have gained through journaling with your healthcare provide

#### Tips for starting a journal
* Commit time to write in your journal on a regular basis – ideally, daily.
* Find a quiet time and place to journal

#### What should I write?
Every person’s journal is different. Here are a few of the things people keep track of in their journals:

* Concerns
* Accomplishments
* Disappointments
* Accounts of interactions with others, both positive and negative

#### What strategies will you use to help yourself commit to journaling more?

### Managing Stress

#### Self-Regulation and Stress

Managing stress should be approached from two different, complementary and interrelated angles:

1. First, stressors -- events or situations that result in the feeling of being overwhelmed or threatened -- should be identified and then assessed to ensure that individuals and groups are differentiating between less controllable sources of stress and those that are more controllable, either through changing the events or situations themselves
or changing one’s response to them.

2. Second, for the less controllable sources of stress there are a broad range of constructive strategies for minimizing the toll they might otherwise take on our physical and emotional well-being.

List the both the controllable and less controllable stressors in your life.

For the less controllable stressors, identify which of the following constructive strategies are you using to manage your
stressors? You are also invited to include your own constructive strategies.

* Meditation, massage, visualization and other techniques that evoke a “relaxation response”- shifting one’s “fight or flight” orientation to a more subdued and introspective one.
* Walking, jogging, yoga, dancing and other “flow oriented” exercise programs.
* Good nutrition. Pay attention to the foods you eat and how they make you feel emotionally and physically.
* Ergonomics- the alignment of a person’s body with their physical workspace.
* Mentorship and coaching that is often included in workplace programs.
* Enjoying music, nature and the arts.
* Charitable activities and volunteer work.
* Teaming up with one’s peers to help with stressful situations.
* Positive recognition of performance milestones and celebration of customs.
* Using humor to balance feelings of anxiety or to laugh at one’s self.

#### Default strategies you that may not serve you and you should watch out for are:

* Substance abuse, overeating, gambling, smoking, and other addictive behaviors.
* Procrastination, excessive time off, and other forms of avoiding responsibility.
* A victim mentality or, conversely, seeking excessive control of the environment.

#### Practicing Self-Management – The five key points to help you master Self-Management:

1. Be consistent. Part of managing oneself is the ability to be stable. The values you hold dear should always be transparent. Always changing can not only cause others to question your beliefs, but it can also cause you to become confused about what you truly believe.
2. Stick to the plan. If you are scheduled to complete a particular task, do it. Don’t just do it, but make sure it is done
in a timely manner. It is easy to feel out of control when you disregard the plan you are to follow.
3. Be accountable. There are times when things don’t work out as you plan, but you have to be able to admit that and then use your flexibility to get things back on track. The ideal result is that you easily bounce back and complete the task, but even during those times when this is not the case, you are expected to adjust.
4. Educate yourself. We live in an ever-changing world and you want to be able to keep up with it.  Don’t let change pass you by, embrace it. Be an avid reader. Talk and listen to mentors and peers. They may know something that could help you along your journey.
5. Stay physically fit. Many people don’t think of staying fit when they talk about self-management, but it is a very important part of being able to practice the four preceding points. Exercising your body is just as crucial to self-management as exercising your mind. A body that is not well rested, nutritionally fed, or physically exercised can lead to emotional and physical illnesses.
