# Course 1: Emotional and Social Intelligence

## Week 1: Emotional and Social Intelligence

### Self-Reflection and Journaling

Self-reflection and journaling are an opportunity to **pause** in order to think about what you have learned or recall events that are relevant to the learning material, to take notice of your thoughts and feelings, and write down what is on your mind. If you have never kept a journal before or done many self-reflection exercises, writing down your thoughts and feelings may seem awkward at first. We encourage you to not let this awkward feeling prevent you from exploring your thoughts and feelings as you progress through this course. Fully utilizing these moments and the tools
provided to you will ensure you have a rich learning experience, and lead to longer retention of the material provided.

### Promoting Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace

The last few decades have changed a lot about doing business. Importantly, there have been many positive developments in how we approach work and team building. One important development is the increased understanding of the impact of emotional intelligence in the workplace.

It’s true that the importance of emotional intelligence for individuals is well understood. But it’s also a critical part of
building a healthy team. Below we explain what emotional intelligence is  and how it can help strengthen your hiring decisions and team dynamics.

#### A Quick Emotional Intelligence Definition

The concept of emotional intelligence, or “emotional quotient” is meant to work alongside IQ — intelligence quotient. IQ doesn’t fully measure a person’s ability or competency. Emotional intelligence, while harder to measure, is a way to complement the picture. A common emotional intelligence definition is “the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.”

Some definitions also include four more precise areas of competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. Of these, self-awareness is considered the core of high EI. If you don’t know yourself and your own motivations, you are poorly equipped to understand others.

One thing that is important to understand is that emotional intelligence in the workplace and elsewhere is not a “soft skill,” and that it is no less important than IQ. It might even be more important. Being able to manage your emotions allows a person to deal with complex and stressful situations more adeptly. High emotional intelligence is a critical trait for leaders and innovators of all types. It helps with everything from building strategies to conflict management.

EQ is a key differentiator in the business world. People with high emotional intelligence make more, perform better and are more likely to close deals.

#### Hiring for Emotional Intelligence

Building a resilient team starts with hiring the right people. We celebrate high performers and brilliant minds, but a team is a team. This means promoting emotional intelligence in the workplace is a must. No one builds a successful
business alone. A team of average performers who work together masterfully is going to outperform a bad team with one star player every time.

Beyond that though, there is evidence that emotional intelligence is a better indicator of individual success as well. Someone with high emotional intelligence is a great hire at every level. It’s hard to measure EQ, so you have to draw it out through personal interaction. Here are some tips on selecting candidates with high emotional intelligence:

Avoid “personality tests.” Personality is not the same as emotional intelligence. Be wary of self-reporting tests as well — if a person isn’t self-aware, how can they report their EQ accurately?

Really talk to the candidate’s references. Make sure to ask specific questions about behaviors that reflect on their emotional intelligence.

Finally, adjust your interview process to emphasize EQ. Speak informally. Ask questions that reveal the candidate’s self-awareness. Put into place hiring practices that give decision-makers time and context to select for this trait.

#### Encouraging Emotional Intelligence on Your Team

Unlike IQ, which is static, EQ is something that can be trained. Like with so many parts of a successful team, it starts with leadership. Make sure that your leadership demonstrates emotional intelligence in your management. Pay attention to your emotions. Encourage self-reflection. Listen actively, and often, and make this a part of your culture.

Additionally, an important part of emotional intelligence in the workplace is responding, rather than just reacting to, difficult situations. Work on managing your unconscious and immediate impulses to frustrating events and people. This takes practice! Learning to deal with difficult moments or difficult colleagues isn’t easy, but model the behavior and encourage it on your team.

It’s also important to celebrate team successes, and not just individual accomplishments. Recognize the parts that everyone played in getting a project to the end point. Having the social awareness to recognize people for their distinct contributions is a key part of emotional intelligence.

#### Emotional Intelligence Skills Are Key to Success

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in or what your goals are, you need to work with people to get things done. This means that understanding and improving emotional intelligence should be a key part of your strategy. One good thing about EQ is that if you practice it yourself, it will impact your team. This is an area where leadership can make a huge difference. Start with the tips above, but remember that it’s a life-long process.

### 7 Examples of High and Low EQ at Work

We know that high EI/EQ in the workplace is an advantage, but how do we know it when we see it? What does it look like? Here are some good examples of high vs. low EI/EQ at work.

#### An Upset Employee Finds a Compassionate Ear

We all get moody sometimes, even at work. How a person deals with her coworkers or employees when they are having a bad day is a good indication about her EI/EQ level.

If she doesn’t even notice the moodiness, ignores the employee, exacerbates the bad mood, or criticizes the employee and tells them to “snap out of it,” she probably has low EI/EQ. If, on the other hand, she notices that something is up, offers her employee compassion and understanding, and tries to cheer the employee up or distract them from their woes, that’s a great indicator that she has high EI/EQ.

##### People Listen to Each Other in Meetings

Unfortunately, not all meetings are positive and productive; sometimes meetings can devolve into everyone talking at once, no one offering any input at all, or-worst of all-shouting and heated arguments.

If an employee contributes to any of the above in a meeting, he is displaying low emotional intelligence. If he allows others to have their say, listens attentively and refrains from interrupting others, and gently but effectively keeps everyone on task, he is probably high in EI/EQ.

#### People Express Themselves Openly

A person who is comfortable speaking up about things that are important, and is just as comfortable listening to others talk about their own opinions, is showing high workplace EI/EQ. She is probably also adept at expressing her own emotions in an appropriate way and accepting of others who express their own emotions.

A person who keeps things bottled up or gets upset when others disagree with her at work is likely low in emotional intelligence. She might spar with her coworkers about their opinions, or conversely, expect everyone to simply keep all emotions and opinions to themselves.

#### Most Change Initiatives Work

If a workplace is generally high in emotional intelligence, it likely handles change well. Change initiatives are probably taken seriously and carried out in earnest.

On the flip side, workplaces with low emotional intelligence are resistant to change, fail to put in the effort necessary to make change initiatives succeed, or even actively sabotage them. Additionally, poorly through-out initiatives indicate that the management team is low in EI/EQ and does not understand how their proposed changes will affect their employees.

#### Flexibility

A workplace that offers flexibility and understanding of the complex, busy lives of organization members is one that is probably high in EI/EQ. Managers and executives who accept that people have differing needs and offer ways to work smarter are displaying a good sense of emotional intelligence.

Managers and executives who refuse to allow their employees flexibility and hold strictly to the way things have always been done (when there is no need to do so) are showing signs of low emotional intelligence.

#### People Have the Freedom to Be Creative

Similarly, workplaces that allow their employees the opportunity to be creative and innovative are high in EI/EQ. Giving people the chance to practice their creativity and think outside the box is not only a welcome gesture for employees, it is also a smart move for the workplace.

Workplaces that make their employees stick to strict policies and procedures (again, when there is no need for such strictness) are low in EI/EQ. Not understanding the value of creativity and our employee’s need to be imaginative and invested in their work is a hallmark of low EI/EQ.

#### People Meet Out of Work Time

Finally, a good sign of emotional intelligence in the workplace is when organization members meet outside of the workplace. Organizations where employees enjoy happy hours, having lunch together, or other social activities indicates that there is a high level of EI/EQ present.

Workplaces that don’t feature such strong bonds and those in which employees do not spend any non-working time together are likely low in EI/EQ. When people are emotionally intelligent, they tend to get along and see the value in investing their time and energy into workplace relationships, but people low in EI/EQ are generally not interested in building quality relationships with their peers (Dhanak, n.d.).

#### Summary

* Develop their teams

##### Low EQ may show up as:

* Emotional outbursts, typically out of proportion to the situation at hand
* Not listening to others

## Week 1: Self-Awareness

### List of Emotions

#### Positive
![](emotions_positive.png)

#### Negative
![](emotions_negative.png)

### Articulate Your Feelings

It’s not enough to know your emotions. People with high ESI have the ability to describe them to others. This communication is key when working with others that are still learning their emotional triggers and how to handle them.

Consider the following situations and describe how you would feel in each situation:

* You read an email that implies you dropped the ball.
* Your partner blames you for something you feel is unfair.
* Another driver cuts you off on the highway.
* A close friend or associate begins to cry unexpectedly.

By first identifying your own emotions and reactions, you become more mindful and start the process of building control.

Note how you typically respond to these situations by answering the following reflection questions. Be honest about your reactions.

1. What are the benefits of your response?
2. What are the consequences of your response?
3. What would be the benefits if you changed your response?
4. What will you do with this knowledge?

### The Ripple Effect of Emotions

We just learned and experienced that our emotions can have a ripple effect on others. Let's examine how many people you could be impacting.

* List the people you encounter each day: face-to-face, phone, email; look above and below yourself in the organization hierarchy.
* How many people do you touch over a week's time?
* How many people look to you for leadership, support, collaboration?
* How many people might be (directly or indirectly) impacted by your emotions or behaviors?
*  What different choices will you make with this information?

### Get Some Feedback

* Listen carefully and try not to get defensive
* Check your perceptions and paraphrase
* Ask questions for clarification; ask for examples, paraphrase again
* Evaluate the accuracy and potential value of what you heard
* Gather additional information from additional sources and/or observe your own behavior
* Do not overreact but do modify behavior when appropriate
* Say “Thank you for the feedback”. Learn to appreciate the learning you receive from feedback

### What Did You Take Away From Self-Awareness?

Take a moment to reflect and answer the following questions:

* What did you take away from the self-reflection exercises?
* What did you learn about the ripple effect of your emotions and behaviors?
* What did you learn about yourself when you asked others for their perspective?
* Remember your best day and a not so good day – what was the difference?

## Week 2: Self-Management and Self-Regulation

### Cognitive Distortion

* All or nothing or polarized thinking: You look at things in absolute, black and white categories.
* Overgeneralization: You view a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
* Mental Filter: You dwell on the negatives and ignore the positives.
* Discounting the positives: You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities “don’t count”.
* Jumping to conclusions: (a) mind reading – you assume people are reacting negatively to you when there’s no definite evidence; (b) fortune telling – you arbitrarily predict things will turn out badly.
* Magnification or Minimization: You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance inappropriately.
* Emotional Reasoning: You reason for how you feel; “I feel like an idiot so I really must be one.” Or “I feel like doing this, so I’ll put it first.”
* Should Statements: You criticize yourself or other people with “should's” or “shouldnt's.” “Musts”, “Oughts”, “have to's” are similar offenders.
* Labeling: YOU identify with your shortcomings. Instead of saying, “I made a mistake,” you tell yourself, “I am a jerk” or “a fool”.
* Personalization and Blame: You blame yourself for something you weren’t entirely responsible for, or you blame others and overlook ways that your own attitudes and behavior might contribute to a problem.

#### Answer the following questions:

* Which of these cognitive distortions resonated with you?
* How could you manage them when they come up?
* How will you change your self-talk?

### Practicing the Pause

"The pause" may be as simple as taking a moment to stop and think before we act or speak. If everyone made that a practice, imagine how much shorter emails could be, how much time would be saved in meetings, and how many incendiary comments on social media would be eliminated.

But remember: The pause is easy in theory, difficult to practice.

Even if we're generally good at managing our emotions, factors like added stress or a bad day can inhibit our ability to do so at any given time. And we're not just talking about upsetting situations; we are often tempted to jump on opportunities that look really good at the time but that we haven't really thought through. When you work on pausing before speaking or acting, you create a habit of thinking first.

![](practice_the_pause.png)

* When was a time that you probably should have practiced the pause and didn't? How might that have changed the situation?
* What strategies can you incorporate to help you practice the pause more often?

### Journaling

#### What is journaling?

Simply put, journaling is “writing life down.” Two key reasons to keep a journal:

#### Recapturing the moment

Spending just a few minutes a day writing in a journal is an opportunity to slowdown, revisit key events of the day, and
describe what happened and what you recall thinking or feeling. Writing to reflect on how you reacted and felt throughout the day can provide useful insight into how you see yourself and the world around you. This knowledge can help you gauge the progress you’re making with your treatment plan.

#### Learning from the moment

Journaling is a great self-teaching tool. It provides a safe environment for examining how changing your thoughts or behaviors might bring about a different outcome. Many people find that once they’ve recounted the day’s events, they can also spend a few minutes journaling about the lessons of the day, and “practicing” alternative ways to react to stress, handle relationships, and recognize and appreciate life’s positive moments.

#### How can journaling help me take care of myself?
If you are looking to become more aware of your thoughts and more skilled at turning them around when you become
counterproductive or destructive, a written journal provides a place to “catch” those thoughts and experiment with how a different way of thinking might impact a given situation. You may find it helpful to share insights you have gained through journaling with your healthcare provide

#### Tips for starting a journal
* Commit time to write in your journal on a regular basis – ideally, daily.
* Find a quiet time and place to journal

#### What should I write?
Every person’s journal is different. Here are a few of the things people keep track of in their journals:

* Concerns
* Accomplishments
* Disappointments
* Accounts of interactions with others, both positive and negative

#### What strategies will you use to help yourself commit to journaling more?

### Managing Stress

#### Self-Regulation and Stress

Managing stress should be approached from two different, complementary and interrelated angles:

1. First, stressors -- events or situations that result in the feeling of being overwhelmed or threatened -- should be identified and then assessed to ensure that individuals and groups are differentiating between less controllable sources of stress and those that are more controllable, either through changing the events or situations themselves
or changing one’s response to them.

2. Second, for the less controllable sources of stress there are a broad range of constructive strategies for minimizing the toll they might otherwise take on our physical and emotional well-being.

List the both the controllable and less controllable stressors in your life.

For the less controllable stressors, identify which of the following constructive strategies are you using to manage your
stressors? You are also invited to include your own constructive strategies.

* Meditation, massage, visualization and other techniques that evoke a “relaxation response”- shifting one’s “fight or flight” orientation to a more subdued and introspective one.
* Walking, jogging, yoga, dancing and other “flow oriented” exercise programs.
* Good nutrition. Pay attention to the foods you eat and how they make you feel emotionally and physically.
* Ergonomics- the alignment of a person’s body with their physical workspace.
* Mentorship and coaching that is often included in workplace programs.
* Enjoying music, nature and the arts.
* Charitable activities and volunteer work.
* Teaming up with one’s peers to help with stressful situations.
* Positive recognition of performance milestones and celebration of customs.
* Using humor to balance feelings of anxiety or to laugh at one’s self.

#### Default strategies you that may not serve you and you should watch out for are:

* Substance abuse, overeating, gambling, smoking, and other addictive behaviors.
* Procrastination, excessive time off, and other forms of avoiding responsibility.
* A victim mentality or, conversely, seeking excessive control of the environment.

#### Practicing Self-Management – The five key points to help you master Self-Management:

1. Be consistent. Part of managing oneself is the ability to be stable. The values you hold dear should always be transparent. Always changing can not only cause others to question your beliefs, but it can also cause you to become confused about what you truly believe.
2. Stick to the plan. If you are scheduled to complete a particular task, do it. Don’t just do it, but make sure it is done
in a timely manner. It is easy to feel out of control when you disregard the plan you are to follow.
3. Be accountable. There are times when things don’t work out as you plan, but you have to be able to admit that and then use your flexibility to get things back on track. The ideal result is that you easily bounce back and complete the task, but even during those times when this is not the case, you are expected to adjust.
4. Educate yourself. We live in an ever-changing world and you want to be able to keep up with it.  Don’t let change pass you by, embrace it. Be an avid reader. Talk and listen to mentors and peers. They may know something that could help you along your journey.
5. Stay physically fit. Many people don’t think of staying fit when they talk about self-management, but it is a very important part of being able to practice the four preceding points. Exercising your body is just as crucial to self-management as exercising your mind. A body that is not well rested, nutritionally fed, or physically exercised can lead to emotional and physical illnesses.

## Week 3: Empathy

### What is Empathy?

Empathy is the ability to recognize emotions in others and to understand other people's perspectives on a situation.  Empathy is described as sensing what people are feeling, being able to take their perspective and cultivating report and attunement with a broad diversity of people.

#### What are the Competencies of Empathy?

1. understanding others
2. developing others
3. having a service orientation
4. leveraging diversity
5. political awareness

#### Empathy is a Powerful Interpersonal Skill

Empathy is one of our greatest interpersonal skills because it allows us to have better communication with people around us and increase our understanding of others. Empathy can simply mean to put ourselves in the other person's shoes. But it can also mean to take an active role in getting to know the people around you and treating them with respect they deserve.  Empathy enables you to use insight to improve someone else's mood and to support them through challenging situations.

#### Empathy VS Sympathy

Empathy is often confused with sympathy, but they are not the same thing. Sympathy is a feeling of concern for someone and a sense that they could be happier. Unlike empathy, sympathy doesn't involve shared perspective or emotions. You can feel sympathy for someone you see in tears on the street, for example, without knowing anything about their situation. Sympathy may develop into empathy, but it doesn't necessarily do so.

#### Effective Empathy

* [Understanding Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAJ6jDoePyY)
* [Brene Brown on Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw)

To use empathy effectively, you need to put aside your own viewpoint and see things from the other person's perspective. Then you can recognize behavior that appears at first sight to be overemotional, stubborn, or unreasonable, as simply a reaction based on a person's prior knowledge and experiences.

### The Stages of Empathy

1. **Cognitive:** the most rational, intellectual and emotionally neutral ability
2. **Emotional:** the ability to share the feelings of another person and so to understand that person on a deeper level
3. **Compassionate:** the most active form of empathy

#### Cognitive Empathy

Cognitive empathy is the ability to understand what another person might be thinking or feeling. It need not involve any emotional engagement by the observer. Managers may find cognitive empathy useful and understanding how their team members are feeling. And therefore, what style of leadership would get the best from them today.  Similarly, sales executives can use it to gauge the mood of the customer. Helping them to choose the most effective tone for a conversation.

#### Emotional Empathy

Sometimes called effective empathy, because it affects you or changes you. It's not just a matter of knowing how someone feels, but of creating genuine rapport with them. For some of us, this kind of empathy can feel overwhelming.  People with strong empathic tendencies can become immersed in other people's problems or pain. Sometimes damaging their own emotional well being. This is particularly true if they don't feel able to resolve the situation. You can avoid this kind of emotional generosity burnout by taking breaks, checking your boundaries and strengthening your ability to cope in such a demanding role.  It helps to build trust between managers and team members and develop honesty and openness. But empathy is most valuable when it's combined with action.

#### Compassionate Empathy

Compassionate empathy is the most active form of empathy. It involves not only having concern for another person and sharing their emotional pain, but also taking practical steps to reduce it. For example, imagine that one of your team members is upset or angry because he or she delivered an important presentation badly. Acknowledging their hurt is valuable and affirming their reaction by showing signs of those feelings yourself is even more valuable. But best of all is putting aside some time for them and offering practical support or guidance on getting through the situation and preparing for next time.

### Techniques for Building Empathy

Empathy is one of the five key components of ESI, emotional and social intelligence, and it helps to build trust and strengthen relationships. To use empathy effectively, give people your full attention, looking out for verbal and nonverbal clues to help you fully understand their situation. Set aside your own assumptions, acknowledge people's feelings, allow an emotional connection, and then take positive action that will improve your and their well being.

**1. Challenge yourself:**
* Undertake challenging experiences that push you outside your comfort zone
* Doing things like this will humble you, and humility is a key enabler of empathy

**2. Get out of your usual environment:**
* Travel, especially to new places and cultures. It gives you a better appreciation for others


**3. Get feedback:**
* Ask for feedback about your relationship skills from family, friends, and colleagues, and then check in with them periodically to see how you're doing.

**4. Explore the heart:**
* Read literature that explores personal relationships and emotions. This has been shown to improve the empathy of young doctors, for example.

**5. Walk in other people's shoes:**
* Talk to others about what it's like to walk in their shoes about their issues and concerns, and how they've perceived experiences you've both shared. You can explore a powerful approach to seeing others points of view with this exercise.

**6. Examine your biases:**
* We all have hidden and sometimes not so hidden biases that interfere with our ability to listen and empathize. These are often centered around visible factors such as age, race, and gender. Don't think you have any biases? Think again, we all do.

**7. Cultivate your sense of curiosity:**
* What can you learn from a very young colleague who's inexperienced? What can you learn from a client who's older and more experienced? Curious people ask a lot of questions leading them to develop a stronger understanding of the people around them.

**8. Listen more:**
* Listen more carefully to what someone's trying to tell you. Use your ears, eyes, and gut instincts to understand the entire message that they're communicating. Start with listening for keywords and phrases that they use, particularly if they use them repeatedly. Then think about how as well as what they're saying. What's their tone or body language telling you?

**9. Ask better questions:**
* Bring three or four thoughtful even provocative questions to every conversation you have with clients, or colleagues, or family members. Prepare for the conversation to change direction as the other person's thoughts and feelings also change.

**10. Take action:**
* There's no one right way to demonstrate your compassion and empathy. It will depend on the situation, the individual, and their dominant emotion at the time. Remember, empathy is not about what you want, but what the other person wants and needs. Any action you take must benefit them. Remember, that empathy is not just for crisis. Seeing the world from a variety of perspectives is a great talent, and it's one of those that you can use all of the time in any situation. This adds to your adaptability and resilience.

**11. Random acts of kindness:**
* Brighten anyone's day and make us feel more empathetic. Practice these skills often. When you take an interest in what others think, feel, and experience, you'll develop a reputation for being caring, trustworthy, and approachable, and you'll be a great asset to your team and your organization.

#### Shifting Perceptual Positions - Walking in Another's Shoes

It has been said that one of the best ways to understand another person’s point of view is to walk a mile in his or her shoes. Using perceptual positions, a person can mentally review (or preview) a situation from a number of different standpoints in order to enrich their appreciation of what is involved.

* **Shifting perceptual positions can help you gain a new perspective on a problem or challenge or learn from an experience.**

The idea of multiple perceptual positions in NLP was inspired by Gregory Bateson, modelled from Virginia Satir and developed in use by John Grinder. By adopting different perceptual positions people can develop new choices for responding to events.

For example: A school day when it starts to snow heavily looks very different from the viewpoint of a pupil, parent, teacher and bus driver. Knowing what to do is almost inevitably harder if the Principal does not consider the views of
everyone involved.

This picture describes the 3 positions you can take:

![](other_persons_shoes.png)

We would like you to use these position descriptions to help you evaluate an event or relationship in your own life. You may use the example of the school day where it is snowing if you can't think of an example from your life.

**See the situation from the first position - You**

See the situation through your own eyes. Be aware of your own thoughts and feelings and how they are impacting on the relationship or event. What are your own needs? What do you want to have happen?

**See the situation from the second position - Other**

Imagine what it is like to be the other in the situation. Put yourself in their shoes - as if you are looking back at yourself, seeing, hearing, and feeling as the other person would, given their own map of the world. What are their needs? What do they want to have happen? What intention lies behind their words and actions?

**See the situation from the third position - Meta**

Take a detached viewpoint and look at the system as a whole. Imagine looking at yourself and the other person 'over there' seeing the two of them interacting. Pay particular attention to actual behavior, body language and the sound of
their voices. What helpful wisdom or advice would you (or someone else) give the you ‘over there’?

**Now go back to the first position – You**
* What is different, what has changed?
* What new options and choices do you now have?
* How will your insights affect the situation or relationship in the future?

#### More on Listening

> People start to heal the moment they feel heard.
>
-[Cheryl Richardson](https://cherylrichardson.com/)

> Listening is the art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, and others over self.
>
-Dean Jackson

There are so many great quotes about listening, probably because it is the skill we all want to see more from people. If you truly want to build your empathy, you must learn to listen.

##### Why is listening so hard?

* We listen at 125 – 250 words per minute, but we think at 1000 – 3000 words per minute.
* According to a study in the year 2000, humans had an attention span of 12 seconds—only 33% longer than a goldfish at 9 seconds. Recently, Microsoft discovered that the average person's attention span is now less than a goldfish at a mere 8 seconds.
* Most of us are distracted, preoccupied, or forgetful about 75% of the time we should be listening.
* Immediately after listening, we recall about 50% of what we hear.
* Long term, we remember only 20% of what we hear.

##### The Five Blind Spots
**1. Assuming everyone thinks like me.**
* Too attached to your own point of view, addicted to being right.

**2. Feelings change our reality.**
* (Dis)Trust changes how we see reality.

**3. I am too fearful to empathize.**
* When we are upset we are unable to connect.

**4. I remember, therefore I know.**
* We actually remember what we thought about what the person was saying, not what they said.
* We drop out of conversation every 12-18 seconds to process what people say.

**5. I am listening so I actually know what you really mean.**
* Meaning resides in the listener, not the speaker.
* We pull meaning from our past experiences to help us interpret what we hear.

##### Keys to Effective Listening

> "We listen in order to learn and retain information. If we are speaking, we are not listening or learning anything to add to our sum of knowledge. This is why the first step to effective listening is to stop talking!"
>
-Ken Fracaro

1. Listen to understand - NOT to respond.
2. Embrace silence.
3. Don't interrupt unless given permission. Ask permission at the beginning of the conversation to interrupt in order to ensure the conversation stays on track.

##### Listening Power Tools
**Paraphrasing** - Paraphrasing shows the other person that you have listened and understand what has been said. To paraphrase, sum up and restate the original information. Your restatement should be shorter than their statements.

Practice by paraphrasing this statement:

"My supervisor really likes my work, and I like the people there. However, I feel like something is missing. I want to have more responsibility, more challenge."

**Reflecting** - Reflecting, or sharing your observations with the other person, can be a powerful tool in your communication. You may hear something that can create new awareness or shift their perspective.

Here are some examples:
* Emotion in their voice
* Expression of what they truly value
* Messages that are inconsistent with their stated goals, values, or priorities
* Gaps in priorities
* Assumptions
* Progress
* Gaps in critical thinking
* Gaps in skills, abilities or training

### Ask Better Questions

Here are a list of examples to help you learn to ask better questions.

![](better_questions.png)


### Empathy in Practice

**How can you practice and build empathy?**

* Look for the good and similar
* Assume positive intent, assume that people have the best of intentions
* Practice a “walk in their shoes”
* Listen better
* Try to identify with what the other person is saying and feeling (perhaps by reflecting on an experience you’ve had that produced a similar emotion in you)
* Look at situation from other person’s point of view
* Ask, a question is always the answer, if you are in doubt about what the other person may need Ask.  If you are curious about what the other person would do or has done in a particular situation, ASK.  Be open and curious and create a to a dialog for understanding.

### Strategies for Building Social Skills

We hope these 10 strategies help you in your efforts to build and maintain relationships.

#### Strategy #1: Observe the ripple effect from your emotions:

Your outpourings of emotion are like stones dropped into a pool of water that send
ripples throughout the people in your life. Since emotions are the primary drivers of your behavior, you need to understand the effect they have on other people.

Your emotions are powerful weapons and continuing to think that their effects are instant and minimal will only do you a disservice. The key to observing the ripple effects
of your emotions is to watch closely how they impact other people immediately and then use that information as a guide for how your emotions are bound to affect a wider circle long after you unleash the emotions. The more you understand how your emotions ripple outward, the better equipped you’ll be to choose the type of ripples that you want to create.

Remember in Module 1 we asked you to examine the number of people whom your emotions may be impacting. Now think back to a recent emotionally charged event.

* What Impact did your emotions leave on others?
* Could it have changed their perception of you?
* What didn’t you realize at the time of the event?
* What could you have done differently?

#### Strategy #2: Manage Perception

Perception can be a hard aspect to learn from since most of the time our perception can only be drawn from our own experiences – and we’re pretty biased when it come to our own thoughts. Perception is an important tool in controlling behavior because it helps us determine how we can appear to others and how other people’s behaviors can influence us. Your belief in yourself can affect your perception and can in turn affect your outward behavior.

Review the Ladder of Inference from Week 3- How will you manage your own perceptions?

Manage the perceptions of others:

We may not always know exactly how people perceive us since many will not say these things out loud, but we can make our own conclusions based on our perception of their behavior.

Reflect on your recent interactions at work and answer the following questions:

* Do co-workers come close when they speak to you or do they try to move away?
* Do they smile and interact with you or do they seem withdrawn?
* How do your perceptions and thoughts impact people and their behaviors?
* How likely is it you form some of the same conclusions and determine how to respond to the behaviors they are displaying.

#### Strategy #3: Know Yourself and Your Triggers

Feedback from ourselves can be just as valuable as feedback from others.  As long as we are being honest with ourselves and not self-deceptive. Reflection gives us a chance to learn from our past experiences (even our mistakes) and recognize the chance for learning opportunities. By reflecting on our actions, we can see firsthand what actions
we took, how they played out, and what kind of effect they had on people.

Reflect on an interaction at work that that triggered a negative emotional response from you.  Use all of your senses to recreate the experience in your mind and reflect on:

* The actions that you took.
* What behaviors showed up?
* What did you feel at the time?
* What type of reactions did you receive from other people?

What could you do differently next time?

#### Strategy #4:  Be open to change

Humans are designed to be creatures of habit. We often have the mindset of “we want what we want when we want it”, and if something throws a kink in our routine, we can get frustrated and upset. Being open to change allows us to adapt to new surroundings and situations and helps us grow as a person. Changing our attitude about ourselves and others can help determine how we build our connections. Sometimes after we receive feedback from our peers, we may need to change how we do things or behave in a group. Perhaps after a meeting we decide we need to change how we plan our presentations. Whatever the reason, it is important to not disregard the importance of your willingness to change and not turn a blind eye to its prospects. Changing how we see ourselves and the people that surround us can have a positive impact on our attitudes and can help build better relationships with our peers.

Tips for accepting change:

* Determine how the change can benefit you
* Don’t assume a need for change is negative
* Recognize that change is a chance for improvement

#### Strategy # 5: Separate Facts from Emotions

The main difference between facts and emotions is that facts are based on definite results while emotions are often involuntary and one-sided. But both facts and emotions can affect our behaviors and change how we act towards others. Facts can drive a conversation and allow people to connect on a logical level. Emotions are involved in everything we do, but sometimes they can affect the impact of our behavior and the information we are talking about.

Any social situation is most likely driven with emotions, and sometimes this can cause facts to become irrelevant and even misconstrue the information given. For example, a male speaker may not be taken seriously at a feminism rally, or a group full of teachers may not listen to a group of school board members. When you recognize that emotion may be driving the situation, it’s time to reflect back on the situation and rediscover the facts and figures of the information. You may have to be a leader in the group and remind everyone to focus on the facts and save the emotions for later.

#### Strategy #6: Build Rapport

Rapport occurs when two or more people feel they are in sync or on the same wavelength. Rapport is the basis for building relationships and being able to influence others.

When building rapport get into rhythm with the other person on as many levels as possible. Body Language Mirroring: Follow along with their body language and gestures. If they sit back, you sit back. If they lean in, you lean in. UNLESS they are overly excited (positively or negatively), then keep your body language more relaxed to help get them to follow you. Watch the personal space – if they keep stepping back that is a clue.

Tips for keeping your personal space personal:

* Excuse yourself politely when leaving a group
* Step to the side a step or two to create subtle distance
* If possible, walk often or roam about the area
* Opt for a handshake when greeting people – it allows for the other person to stay at arm’s length
* Be aware of cultural differences in personal space

Mirroring language and seeking clarity: Use the same words they use and ask for the definition behind those words to help you get more in tune with the other person. For more on Body Language watch Body Language Expert Mark Bowden:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_SMBIW1mg&t=153s

Mirror pitch, volume, pace and timbre: Match their tone of voice and the pace of their speech as well as the volume they are speaking. This one works really well in video or phone conferencing situations when you cannot see their full body language. Again, if they are overly excited (positively or negatively), then keep your tone, pace and volume more relaxed to help get them to follow you

Reflect back on any body language cues you may have used and make note of any cues you may have seen in others.

* What intuitions or gut feelings do you feel from the experience?
* Do you feel as though you have learned anything new from the experience?

These steps and process can help you reflect back on your actions and increase not only your self-awareness, but your awareness of others.

#### Strategy #7: Greet people by name

Greeting people by their names not only acknowledges them as the essence of who they are, but also allows you to remain connected to them in more than just a superficial way. If you find it hard to remember people’s names, try these practices: if the name sounds unusual to you, ask the person to spell it for you so you can picture the name written. Be sure to use the person’s name at least twice during the conversation. Greeting someone by name is one of the most basic and influential social awareness strategies you can adopt. It’s a personal and meaningful way to engage someone.

When we meet new people, sometimes the names or faces can become a blur. Most people are great at remembering one or the other, but rarely both. But rapport depends on being able to recall a person at a later time over many encounters. One of the main reasons we forget a person’s name or face is because we are not truly listening or paying attention when we are being introduced. Don’t be nervous and put your mind at ease so that you can easily register the person’s face and hearing their name with it. When you look at the person, look for any features that stand out, such as hair color, facial features, scars or even the use of makeup. Remembering a key characteristic while fully listening to their name will help keep them associated in your brain to retrieve at a later date when needed

Tips to remember name and faces:

* Say their name immediately after hearing it
* Don’t be afraid to ask them to repeat their name
* Associate a gesture with their greeting, such as a handshake or smile
* Remember distinct features

#### Strategy #8: Make Timing Everything

When dealing with people and their emotions, timing really is everything. You don’t ask for a raise when business is not going well, and you don’t ask for a favor when someone is under a lot of stress or angry. To practice your time as it relates to social awareness, start working on your timing with asking questions. The goal is to ask the right questions at the right time with the right frame of mind, all with your audience in mind, not yourself. The key to social awareness
is focusing on others instead of yourself so that you can be more effective.

Consider this work situation: You’re talking to a colleague who was venting about her spouse. She’s concerned about her marriage and is showing more emotion than ever. But as a response, you blurt out the question, “Have you thought about what ideas you have for the project proposal yet?” She stares at you blankly and is blindsided by your question. Obviously, you weren’t even listening to what she was saying. Her face drops. The conversation is over. In this case, the timing, the question, and the frame of mind were wrong. You asked the wrong question at the right time for you; but the time and frame of mind of the other person were way off. Remember, this isn’t about you – it’s about the other person.

#### Strategy #9: Be Open and Be Curious

Being open means sharing information about yourself with others. You can use your self-management skills to choose how open you are and what you share but know that there is a benefit to opening up that may help you with your choices: when people know about you, there is less room for them to misinterpret you. For example, let’s say that you are particularly sensitive about showing up five minutes early to meetings, and that you get annoyed when people stroll in at the very beginning of the meeting or even a little late. Some people might interpret this as being uptight and rigid. But if you shared with those same people that you were in the Marines for the first years of your career, your coworkers might understand better and maybe even appreciate your sense of timing and courtesy.

The flip side of being open is being curious about the other person. The more you show interest in and learn about the other person, the better shot you have that meeting his or her needs and not misinterpreting them. Just be sure to keep your tone inquisitive and not judgmental.

#### Strategy #10: When You Care, Show It!!

There are people who do great work around you every day. When you care, show it. Don’t hesitate or put it off until next week. Do something this week or even today. Things as simple as a greeting card or something else inexpensive, yet meaningful, that sums up how you feel are all you need to make an impact and strengthen a relationship.

# Course 2: Critical Thinking Skills for the Professional

## Week 1: Introduction to Problem Solving

* [What is Critical Thinking?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn_7aJP5BTw)
* [7 Reasons Why Critical Thinking is Important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaCIycmx8NA)
  1. encourages independence
  2. improves your self-evaluation
  3. promotes good language and presentation skills
  4. encourages creativity and innovation
  5. encourages good decision making
  6. encourages scientific discoveries and theories
  7. keeps us up-to-date with the 21<sup>st</sup> century

### 7 steps to problem solving

1. Problem Identification
2. Reframe
3. Brainstorm
4. Choose 3
5. Advantages & Disadvantages
6. Prepare & Recommend
7. Engage Feedback

### 1. Problem Identification

When we have problems where other people are involved it's really important to do this step together. So these are the questions that you need to ask to really understand what's going on when a problem exists:
* Who, what, when, where, why and how?

Take a reality check with real transparency and access the question:
* What is my role in the problem?

### 2. Reframe

Transform the problem into an opportunity for improvement.

1. Reframe the problem statement from step 1 into a goal
2. Agree upon the goal with the involved participants
3. Formulate a question from the goal to prepare for brainstorming solutions in step 3

## Week 2: Brainstorming and Analyzing Options

### 3. Brainstorming

There are 2 kinds of brainstorming:

1. Individual
2. Group

![](brainstorming_individual_vs_group.png)

#### Individual Brainstorming

You don't have to worry about other people's egos or opinions, and you can be freer and more creative.

#### Group Brainstorming

With group brainstorming you can take advantage of the full experience and creativity of all team members. When one member gets stuck with an idea another member's creativity and experience can take that idea to the next stage.  You can develop ideas in greater depth with group brainstorming than you can with individual brainstorming.  Another advantage of group brainstorming is that it helps everyone feel that they've contributed to the solution and it reminds people that others have creative ideas to offer.  It's also fun, so it can be great for team building.

#### Technique for Combining Individual and Group Brainstorming

Let's learn a technique that combines individual brainstorming into a group brainstorming activity. This is a really great approach when blocking occurs. On a piece of paper, each person writes down their own reframed problem at the top of the page. This is the question that you created in step two to launch brainstorming. So for example, my reframed goal orient- goal oriented question is, what strategies can I implement to ensure that I eat healthy and still have time to meet my important commitments?  So then you pass the paper to the right, and the person next to you can write down an idea to solve your problem.

#### Brainstorming Guidelines

![](brainstorming_summary.png)

What about if someone has a good idea? Really, don't say, "hey man, that's a great idea." Seriously, why not? It's hard to not say that's a great idea. The reason we don't say it, is as soon as you say it's a great idea, there's a real pull to stop the brainstorming process and go with that idea. In the moment, it might feel like you're saving time, but in the end, it may not be that long-term solution. Resist the pull to judge, it's not easy, but it's the right thing to do. It keeps the flow of critical thinking going. To summarize, brainstorm non-judgmentally because some of the best ideas come from the ones that are the most ridiculous.  Because even a bad idea can launch the thought process for something that's good. It's better to have crazy and realistic, fun, outlandish ideas than none at all. Then you can pull back later and mold into something that works. You often get the best results of group brainstorming by managing the process according to these guidelines. By doing this, you can get people to focus on the issue without interruption, you can maximize the number of ideas that you generate, and you get that great feeling of team bonding that comes with a well-run brainstorming session.

After all your ideas are on the table, or the wall, or in [Google Jamboard](https://edu.google.com/products/jamboard/), begin to group the ideas together into similar ideas. Have everyone involved in the grouping, makes sure it's not left up to one or even just a few individuals. Why do you think that's important? Well, it's important for buy-in and engagement. When grouping those ideas together, take your time as a group and focus on one conversation at a time. It's easy for small groups to have side conversations and start deciding things in subgroups, really try to avoid that. You might even appoint someone to keep the group focused. You really want to keep everyone on the same page. Once you group the ideas, you'll start to formulate your solution. Here's a graphic to show how your mind-map approach helps you to categorize and wrap up your brainstorming session.

![](group_ideas.png)

#### Brainstorming Summary

* Step 1
  * brainstorm non-judgementally
  * share ideas on post-its
  * group ideas together into themes

* Step 2
  * discuss and narrow down to 3 solutions

### 4. Choose the Top 3 Solutions

It is important to consider different solutions and different perspectives before continuing onto the advantages and disadvantages of each individual solution to consider all data points and stakeholders of the problem and its proposed solutions.

### 5. Advantages and disadvantages

* Success or failure?
* Long-term result or temporary fix?
* Potential outcomes?
* Who will support each one and why?
* Viable solution for long-term results?

#### Rubber Ducky

One of the things that can be really helpful is to picture yourself communicating these ideas and what do you think people's responses will be? How might this idea play out? What could possibly happen both positive and negative? What pushback will there be?  What potential subsequent problems might exist? Will this solution have any barriers as far as logistics or budget? Will leadership buy-in? Is it practical? Are there any communication challenges involved in rolling out this solution?  Other considerations might be around culture, rules, regulations, processes, procedures, human resistance to change, etc.

## Week 3: Prepare and Recommend

Ask common questions to prepare a robust recommendation by using critical thinking skills to show initiative and improve the odds of approval.

* What is your plan and timeline?
* What resources and needed for implementation?
* What potential questions might be asked by the decision maker?
* How will you ask for approval?

### 6. Prepare and Recommend

#### Be

* Confident and honest
* Calm and collected (not too excited)
* Open minded
* Organized and composed
* Respectful and prepared for a "yes" or "no"

#### Avoid

* Defensiveness
* Strong emotions
* Forceful, threatening, catastrophizing, aggrandizing

### 7. Engage Feedback

#### Saying "yes"

* Yes, I like it as it is, it looks great.
* That's a great idea. Could we just make these changes?
* I love that idea, I'd like to get a little bit more details on it though.
  * What caused you to go in that direction?

#### Saying "no"

* What other solutions were discussed?
* Well, that's interesting. Tell me how you got to that solution.
* That's really an interesting idea. You know, some other information that I think we should take a look at before we make our final decision is...
* Who all did you talk to before you came to that decision?
  * Recommend others be included on the decision
* Provide overlooked information or perspective to help develop another solution

### Foundations of a Growth Mindset

> Let go of who you think you should be in order to be who you are.  Be imperfect and have compassion for yourself.
>
-[Brene Brown](https://brenebrown.com/)

#### Fixed Mindset

Intelligence is static.  This leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to:

* **Challenges:** avoid challenges
* **Obstacles:** give up easily
* **Effort:** see effort as fruitless or worse
* **Criticism:** ignore useful negative feedback
* **Success of Others:** feel threatened by the success of others

#### Growth Mindset

Intelligence can be developed.  This leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to:

* **Challenges:** embrace challenges
* **Obstacles:** persist in the face of setbacks
* **Effort:** see effort as the path to mastery
* **Criticism:** learn from criticism
* **Success of Others:** find lessons and inspiration in the success of others

##### Benefits Growth Mindset

We are more likely to:

1. Start
2. Stick with it
3. Stay hungry

##### Characteristics of Growth Mindset

* Intellectually curious, lifelong learners
* Creative (thus more resilient)
* Flexible and adaptable (thus handle change well)
* More collaborative
  * don't get stuck thinking their way is the best or only way
  * thinking on their own (not just following the group decisions)
* Failure is temporary setback which can be overcome
  * Feedback is accepted as constructive criticism

#### 4-Step Mindset Shift Process

1. Listen to that fixed mindset voice
2. Recognize the patterns
3. Identify areas you want to shift
4. Practice

##### Step 1: Listen

* To the fixed mindset voice
* Name your voice
  * Persona
  * Name
  * Label
* Gives you objectivity and distance (a perspective outside of yourself)

##### Step 1: Questions to Consider

* What happens when that fixed mindset voice shows up?
* How does it make you feel?
* How do you react?

##### Step 2: Recognize Patterns

What **triggers** the fixed mindset?

* Stress
* Anxiety
* Really busy
* Tight deadlines
* New or challenging projects
* Particular person or relationship

##### Step 2: Questions to Consider

* What circumstances or situations where you feel the fixed mindset?
* What events take you to a place of judgement and others?

##### Step 3: Identify Your Shift

Identify which patterns you actually want to shift to a growth mindset.  Pay attention to:

* How you react to mistakes
* How you react to challenges
* How you react to receiving feedback and constructive criticism

##### Step 4: Practice

* Focus on shifting to a growth mindset
* Practice the mindset shift exercises throughout this course

### New Pathways to Learning: Geeking Out on Neuroscience

#### [Neuroplasticity (2 mins video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=ELpfYCZa87g)
* The idea that our brain (neuro) can be molded (like plastic)
* What we focus on and how we discipline our thoughts and attitudes encourages brain growth in those areas
* New neural pathways are made
* What fires together, wires together
* Brain is like a muscle, so we need challenge and obstacles to grow

### The Art of Becoming

> The journey between who you once were and who you are now becoming, is where the dance of life really takes place.
>
-[Dr. Barabara De Angelis](http://barbaradeangelis.com/)

How do we bridge the gap between who we are and who we want to be?

1. Deliberate Practice
2. The Power of "Not Yet"

#### Deliberate Practice

Work that stretches us beyond our comfort zone.  Create plan and execute it to push the brain to grow.

* Be purposeful and systematic
* Requires focused attention
* Be deliberate and practice

#### The Power of "Not Yet"

A mindset reframe when we plateau and/or get stuck: "I can't do this... **yet**"

### Mindset is a Spectrum

Does mindset change?  Yes, many factors influence our mindset moments which vacillate from fixed mindset to growth mindset:

* the location and environment
* the people we interact with
* the project we are working on

Because our ephemeral mindset varies, we need to pay attention to how we are reacting in different circumstances and settings: work, family, community, friends, volunteer activities, sports, athletics, and hobbies.

### Organizations Can Exhibit a Growth Mindset

![](org_growth_mindset.png)

* Growth mindsets transfer from one domain to another
* People are the soul of an organization, so yes it can have a mindset
